    <h1>About Me!</h1>

    <p class="blurb"> I'm a full-time student working towards a VCD major at EWU, and artist in my spare time. I'm graduating soon (and by soon I'm hoping within the year!) and as soon as I'm done I want to step out and do something good. I feel that designers have a lot of power in this world. Designers get to decide how something is represented and who they design for. All I want is to do someting good for the world, to make people feel safe, warm. To feel like they are in their ideal home where they can relax and not worry about a thing.</p>
    <p class="blurb"> For my style, I always aim for soft and comfortable, very similar to my preferred fashion styling! Soft pastels, hand styled fonts, and a center balance permeate my style. I embrace it whole heartedly, and while it may not be for you, I only hope we can see the beauty in every designers style. I'm also very much influnced by the culture and styling around Japan. It is a unique place with unique people and I believe that integrating more styles from the world into our designs should happen. In a world where we are so connected via the Internet, why shouldn't we adopt some styles of other cultures?</p>
